# Grunt
Grunt is a stupid orc chatbot that was created using Python. How stupid he stays however depends on the GitHub community so feel free to make him smarter. I will continue to make improvements on this project and I welcome others to contribute as much or as little as they want so fork away.
 

## Getting Started
Open the "Talk With Grunt" file using a text editor like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download) and then run it so you can talk with Grunt.
