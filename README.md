## THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!

Grunt is a Python chatbot that was inspired by [orcs](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=11682/horde-grunt) from the Warcraft games. Orcs arenâ€™t exactly known for their silver tongue and Grunt is no different. This is a very basic chatbot that can only give simple replies to very specific questions but the goal of this project is to make Grunt more and more sophisticated as time progressess. This project could turn into a decision-based RPG game where the replies you give to Grunt can give you multiple endings but my main ambition is to make a good chatbot no matter its purpose so feel free to fork this project and use Grunt however you like. 
 

## Getting Started
Open the "Talk With Grunt" file using a text editor like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download) and then run it so you can talk with Grunt.
